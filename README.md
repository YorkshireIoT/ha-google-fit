This integration interfaces with the [Google Fit REST API][rest-api] to provide Google Fit
data within Home Assistant.

**This integration will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Name |Description
-- | -- | --
`sensor` | `active_minutes_daily` | Active Minutes. Reset daily.
`sensor` | `calories_burnt_daily` | Calories burnt (kcal). Reset daily.
`sensor` | `distance_travelled_daily` | Distance (metres) travelled. Reset daily.
`sensor` | `heart_points_daily` | Heart Points earned. Reset daily.
`sensor` | `height` | Height (metres).
`sensor` | `weight` | Weight (kilograms).
`sensor` | `steps` | Number of steps taken. Reset daily.

## Prerequisites

### Authentication Configuration

I will not try to duplicate what has already been documented countless times before as it will no doubt become out
of date.

Instead, follow the instruction in the Official home Assistant Docs for [Google Mail][google-mail] under the
"Generate Client ID and Client Secret" section, replacing instructions for 'Gmail API' with 'Fit API'.
